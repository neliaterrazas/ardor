            <p>What Is Natural Wine?</p>
          </div>

          <div class="natural-wine-info">
            <p>What we call natural wines are wines made with the least possible use of chemicals, additives and overly technological procedures. This includes chemicals in the field, such as pesticides, as well as the things in wine like sulfur or any of the almost 200 allowed additives that are legally permitted in wine. It includes many technological manipulations of wine that we think erase the individuality of the product and the place it comes from — the terroir. Our definition of natural wine is very similar to the German purity laws of beer making, which say that beer can be made only of water, barley, and hops. Purely natural wine, to us, is made of grape juice and little else.</p>
            <p>There are a lot of ways one can get to a wine we would consider natural. They include organic and biodynamic grape growing. But grape growing is just that: what is done in the fields. For a wine to really be natural for us, the same philosophies must continue into the winery up until bottling occurs.</p>
            <p>It must also be vinified as naturally as possible. This means that after it has been cultivated organically or biodynamically, there must be a minimal use of additives and technological manipulations. Examples of additives include sugar, acidifiers, and powdered tannins. Manipulations can include the use of spinning cones to remove alcohol, micro-oxygenation to accelerate aging, and the use of laboratory cultivated yeast.</p>
            <p>*The key aspects of what we consider to be a natural wine are:</p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Vineyards farmed organically and/or biodynamically</li>
                <li>Use of indigenous yeast</li>
                <li>Handpicked grape</li>
                <li>Low to no filtering</li>
                <li>Low to no sulfites</li>
                <li>Winemaking that respects the grapes</li>
                <li>No chaptalization</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This style of winemaking for us represents an excellent way to express terroir. We do not eschew modernity, but we favor techniques that help to express a sense of place, rather than new-fangled modern ones that tend to homogenize wine styles and erase individuality.</p>

            Ardor Natural Wines builds community around small-production natural wines. We appreciate character-driven wines that focus on terroir and receive minimal intervention from the winemaker.</p>
            <p>We sell unique wines from all over the world. The selection is frequently changing based on the wines available to us that we are vibing with. Our selections are produced and imported in very limited quantities so frequent changes to our list should be anticipated.</p>
            <p>Our wines run the spectrum from inexpensive vin de soif to hard to find boutique producers. Ardor aims to remove the pretense often associated with wine — it is a delicious beverage. Wine began as, and should continue to be, an accessible drink for all people.</p>

            <p>Ardor has a wine club. Our wine club selects two or four natural wines for you each month. You can sign up for our wine club via email (info@ardornaturalwines.com), in the shop, or over the phone.</p>
            <p>Many of these wines are crafted in very small quantities, are sought after, or can be hard to obtain. This means that very little of this wine ever has the opportunity to leave its place of origin. We want people from all over the state (and country) to be able to enjoy these natural wines. In an effort to share our wines with a broader audience, we offer the wine club.</p>
            <p>HOW IT WORKS:</p>
            <p>Each month we put together 3 different ways for you to order. All selections feature exceptional wines from carefully chosen winemakers and vineyard sites. With each wine, we include a bio about the wine, winemaker, and vineyard so you know the people and the story behind the wine. Your wine is available for in-store pick-up on the first Friday of every month. Shipping is available for an additional fee.</p>
            <p>There are three ways to sign up for the club. Monthly, you can choose to receive:</p>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>2 bottles great wine for $48.</li>
                <li>2 bottles of more compelling wines for $68.</li>
                <li>All 4 bottles, of both allocations, for a discounted $108.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>If you would like to make a custom order or would like to request specific wines, please reach out to us. We will do everything we can to help you get the wines you want.</p>
